Foodie - MERN Stack Food Delivery App
Foodie is a modern and responsive food delivery application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The app offers seamless functionality for users to explore, add food items to their cart, and place orders. With robust user authentication and data security features, it provides an engaging and safe user experience.
This project is inspired by the End-to-End MERN Stack Playlist by Arshdeep Singh, whose guidance was instrumental in building this app.

 Features:
 1. User Authentication:
- Implemented user sign-up and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt to ensure user data protection.
 2. Food Menu and Add to Cart:
- Display a variety of food items fetched dynamically from the backend.
- Users can browse food items and add them to their cart for future checkout.
 3. My Cart:
- A dedicated cart page where users can view items added to their cart.
- Items in the cart can be updated or removed as per user preferences.
 4. Responsive Design:
- Leveraged React-Bootstrap to ensure the app is fully responsive across devices, providing a consistent experience for desktop, tablet, and mobile users.
